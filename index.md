# Use cases

## Broadcasting to underserved audiences

We developed <em>Tinyfm</em> in Qatar, and we've sent it to South Africa already.
Soon, we'll be testing it in India. In all of these places, western media organisations 
struggle to attract an audience, in particular a young one.


## Preserving endangered and rare dialects

> Some languages are lost because nobody has the chance to listen to them, 
in addition to not being able to speak them.
 

Tinyfm's playlist is controlled by the local community itself. Its tiny spatial range 
 is **ideal for a community caf√©** or a neighbourhood.

## Sending the radio experience to remote places

You only need <em>one</em> Raspberry Pi connected to the internet to push and
deliver content to your audience on the airwaves. Obviously, the bigger
the antenna, the more distance you'll cover. Tinyfm's web interface and 
control allow you to remotely send content - whether you're a broadcaster 
or a member of the community.
